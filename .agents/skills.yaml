# Skill Registry Configuration
#
# This file is the canonical source of truth for all skills, squads,

#   1. Add an entry under `skills:` below
#   2. Create .agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
#   3. Restart the system (or run `bun run validate-skills`)
#
# No TypeScript changes needed. No recompile.
