# Tool Registry Configuration
#
# Declare which external tools agents can access.
# Each tool is bound to specific skills — only authorized skills can invoke it.
#
# To add a tool:
#   1. Add an entry under `tools:` below
#   2. Restart the system
#
# Example:
#   ga4:
#     description: "Google Analytics 4 — read traffic and conversion data"
#     provider: stub
#     skills: [analytics-tracking, ab-test-setup]
#     actions:
#       - name: query-events
#         description: "Query GA4 event data"
#         parameters:
#           type: object
#           properties:
#             start_date: { type: string }
#             end_date: { type: string }
#           required: [start_date, end_date]
